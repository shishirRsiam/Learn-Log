Let's make a **tailored mini roadmap** for you, focused on:

> **Shell Scripting 🔧 + Cybersecurity 🛡️ + Productivity ⚡**

---

## 🚀 Shell + Cybersecurity Roadmap

### 🗓️ Week 1: Shell Scripting Basics + Productivity

**Goal**: Learn syntax, write useful scripts, automate your workflow.

#### 🔹 Topics:
- Bash shell basics (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`)
- Variables, loops, conditions
- File handling (`touch`, `cat`, `echo`, `>>`, `<<`)
- Permissions (`chmod`, `chown`, `umask`)
- Cron jobs (automation!)
- Writing your first automation scripts:
  - Auto backup a folder
  - Clean temp files
  - Rename/move files in bulk

#### 🛠 Practice:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# auto_backup.sh
tar -czf backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz /path/to/your/project
```

### 🗓️ Week 2: Cybersecurity Foundation with Shell

**Goal**: Use shell to analyze, monitor, and test basic security tasks.

#### 🔹 Topics:
- Log analysis using `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, `tail`
- Monitor SSH logs: `/var/log/auth.log`
- Scan ports & services using:
  - `nmap`
  - `netstat`
  - `ss`
- File integrity & suspicious SUIDs:
  - `find / -perm -4000`
- Bash alerts with email or desktop notification

#### 🛠 Practice:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ssh_monitor.sh
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | tail -n 10
```

### 🗓️ Week 3: Offensive Basics (Red Team Intro)

**Goal**: Start using scripts to run basic offensive security tools.

#### 🔹 Topics:
- `netcat` for reverse shell + port listening
- `hydra` and brute-force basics (ethically!)
- Scripting automation for:
  - Enumeration (`whoami`, `uname -a`, `ifconfig`)
  - Payload triggering (custom reverse shell)
- Using `bash` for persistence or payload delivery (in a lab!)

#### 🛠 Practice:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# simple_enum.sh
echo "User: $(whoami)"
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "IP: $(hostname -I)"
```

---

### 🗓️ Week 4: Defensive Basics (Blue Team Intro)

**Goal**: Detect and protect using shell.

#### 🔹 Topics:
- Watch for new users: `/etc/passwd` monitoring
- Monitor file changes with `md5sum` and cron
- Auto-block IPs with too many failed attempts
- Basic `iptables` rules with bash
- Create a basic firewall rule script

#### 🛠 Practice:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# block_failed_ips.sh
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $(NF-3)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### 📘 Bonus Tips

- Use a **Kali Linux VM** or **TryHackMe**/**HackTheBox** to test.
- Create a GitHub repo: `ShellSec-Scripts` and upload your tools.
- Follow security YouTubers: LiveOverflow, STÖK, The Cyber Mentor.
- Read: [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) for hands-on fun.
