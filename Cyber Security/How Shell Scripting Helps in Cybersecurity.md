### 🛡️ How Shell Scripting Helps in Cybersecurity

| Area                        | How Shell Scripting Helps                                                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automation**              | Automate scanning tools (like `nmap`, `nikto`, `netcat`, etc.)             |
| **Penetration Testing**     | Write custom scripts to test vulnerabilities, brute-force, or exploit tools|
| **Log Analysis**            | Parse logs for unusual activity (e.g., in `/var/log/auth.log`)             |
| **Monitoring & Defense**    | Create cron jobs to monitor file changes, open ports, failed logins        |
| **Red Teaming**             | Automate attack vectors, payload execution, or reverse shell deployment    |
| **Blue Teaming (Defense)**  | Set up firewall rules, alerts, incident response scripts                   |

### 📁 Examples of What You Can Do with Shell in Cybersecurity

- 🔍 Scan for open ports and services:
  ```bash
  nmap -sS $target_ip > scan_results.txt
  ```

- 🚨 Alert for unauthorized SSH logins:
  ```bash
  grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | mail -s "SSH Alert" you@example.com
  ```

- 🧪 Auto run tools in sequence:
  ```bash
  ./recon.sh && ./scan.sh && ./exploit.sh
  ```

- 🛑 Monitor for privilege escalation:
  ```bash
  find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null > suspicious_suid.txt
  ```
