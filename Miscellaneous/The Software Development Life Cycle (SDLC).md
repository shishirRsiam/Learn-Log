The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a **structured process** used by software developers and project managers to **design, develop, test, and deploy** software efficiently and effectively. It provides a **framework** that ensures quality and correctness in the software being built.

---

### üîÑ **Phases of SDLC:**

Here are the common **phases** in SDLC:

---

### 1. **Planning**
- **Goal**: Understand the project scope and feasibility.
- **Activities**:
  - Resource planning
  - Budget estimation
  - Risk analysis
  - Timeline setting

---

### 2. **Requirement Analysis**
- **Goal**: Gather and analyze what the software needs to do.
- **Activities**:
  - Talking to stakeholders
  - Documenting functional & non-functional requirements
  - Creating requirement specifications

---

### 3. **Design**
- **Goal**: Create architecture and detailed design of the software.
- **Activities**:
  - UI/UX design
  - Database design
  - System architecture (e.g., MVC, microservices)
  - Create design documents

---

### 4. **Development (Coding)**
- **Goal**: Convert design into a working product by writing code.
- **Activities**:
  - Developers write code in chosen language
  - Follow coding standards
  - Use version control (like Git)

---

### 5. **Testing**
- **Goal**: Ensure software works as expected and is bug-free.
- **Activities**:
  - Unit testing, Integration testing, System testing
  - Manual and automated testing
  - Bug reporting and fixing

---

### 6. **Deployment**
- **Goal**: Release the software to users.
- **Activities**:
  - Deploy on server/cloud
  - Rollout (could be gradual or all at once)
  - Monitor for issues

---

### 7. **Maintenance**
- **Goal**: Keep the software updated and bug-free after release.
- **Activities**:
  - Fix issues reported by users
  - Release patches or updates
  - Improve performance/security

---

### üîÅ SDLC Models:
- **Waterfall** ‚Äì Linear, one phase after another.
- **Agile** ‚Äì Iterative, continuous feedback, fast changes.
- **Spiral** ‚Äì Risk-driven model.
- **V-Model** ‚Äì Testing is planned alongside development.
- **Iterative** ‚Äì Build quickly, then improve with each iteration.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of SDLC:
- Better project management
- Reduced development cost and time
- Improved product quality
- Clear documentation and goals
