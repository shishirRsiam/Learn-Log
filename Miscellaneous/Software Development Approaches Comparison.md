### üìã **Software Development Approaches Comparison**

| üß† **Approach / Principle** | üí° **Meaning** | ‚úÖ **Goal** | üß∞ **Key Benefit** |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Clean Code**              | Write code that is readable, simple, and well-structured | Maintainability & readability | Easier to understand, modify, and scale code |
| **SOLID**                   | Set of 5 OOP design principles | Scalable and robust architecture | Helps avoid code smells, improves flexibility |
| **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** | Avoid code duplication | Reusability | Reduces bugs and keeps code consistent |
| **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** | Simpler code > Complex code | Simplicity | Easier debugging and faster development |
| **YAGNI (You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It)** | Don‚Äôt build features you don‚Äôt need right now | Focus | Saves time, avoids over-engineering |
| **Agile / Scrum**           | Iterative and incremental process | Quick delivery and adaptability | Delivers fast, responds to change quickly |
| **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** | Write tests before writing code | Code correctness & design | Leads to fewer bugs and better structure |

### üîç Example:
Let‚Äôs say you're building a **blog application**:
- Use **Clean Code** for naming and organizing your models and views.
- Follow **SOLID** when designing your services and handling logic.
- Apply **DRY** by reusing pagination or comment logic in multiple views.
- Keep it **KISS** by not overcomplicating comment moderation.
- Skip features like "advanced analytics" (YAGNI) unless users request them.
- Manage development in **Agile** sprints.
- Write **TDD** unit tests for post creation, editing, and deletion.
