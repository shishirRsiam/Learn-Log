### **What is an EC2 instance?**
**EC2** stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud**. It's a service by **AWS** (Amazon Web Services) that provides **virtual servers (instances)** in the cloud.

- Think of it like a **computer in the cloud** where you can run applications.
- You choose how much CPU, memory, storage, etc., you want.
- You can install your own operating system, software, and control everything.
- It's **not serverless**—you manage when it starts, stops, and scales.

### Now comparing with:
#### ✅ **Lambda**:
- It's **serverless**.
- You write functions and AWS runs them for you **only when needed**.
- You **don’t manage any server**.
- Best for small, event-driven tasks like running code when a file is uploaded or an API is called.

#### ✅ **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**:
- It's **object storage**.
- Use it to **store files**, such as images, videos, backups, etc.
- Not a compute service like EC2 or Lambda.
