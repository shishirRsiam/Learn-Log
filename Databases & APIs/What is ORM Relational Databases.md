**Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a technique used in software development to interact with a relational database using an object-oriented paradigm. ORM allows developers to work with databases using high-level programming languages like Python, Java, or C# rather than SQL. This means that instead of writing SQL queries to manipulate data in the database, developers can use their programming languageâ€™s classes and objects.

In simpler terms, ORM acts as a bridge between an object-oriented system and a relational database. It allows you to:

1. **Map objects to database tables**: Each class in the programming language corresponds to a table in the database, and each object of that class corresponds to a row in that table.
   
2. **Automate SQL query generation**: ORM frameworks automatically generate the necessary SQL queries to interact with the database (insert, update, delete, select) based on the methods called on the objects.

Some popular ORM frameworks are:
- **Django ORM** (for Python)
- **Hibernate** (for Java)
- **Entity Framework** (for C#)

**Relational Databases** are databases that store data in tables that are related to one another. These databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and managing data. Data is stored in rows and columns within tables, and relationships are established between tables using keys.

A **relational database** typically follows the **ACID** principles (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable transactions. The main features of relational databases include:

- **Tables**: Data is stored in tables (also known as relations), where each table represents an entity (e.g., "Customers," "Orders").
- **Rows and Columns**: A table is made up of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of that record.
- **Keys**: Relationships between tables are established using keys:
  - **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
  - **Foreign Key**: A column or group of columns used to establish a link between the data in two tables.

Examples of relational databases are:
- **MySQL**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **SQLite**
- **Oracle Database**

In summary, ORM is a tool for translating between object-oriented programming concepts and relational databases, while relational databases are systems that store data in a structured format using tables and relationships.
